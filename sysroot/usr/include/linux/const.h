 * Similarly, _AT() will cast an expression with a type in C, but
 * leave it unchanged in asm.

 * Missing __asm__ support
 *
 * __BIT128() would not work in the __asm__ code, as it shifts an
 * 'unsigned __int128' data type as direct representation of
 * 128 bit constants is not supported in the gcc compiler, as
 * they get silently truncated.
 *
 * TODO: Please revisit this implementation when gcc compiler
 * starts representing 128 bit constants directly like long
 * and unsigned long etc. Subsequently drop the comment for
 * GENMASK_U128() which would then start supporting __asm__ code.
