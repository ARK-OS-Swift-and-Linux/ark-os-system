/* Maximum length of the 'struct iovec' array in a single call to
   readv or writev.

   This macro has different values in different kernel versions.  The
   latest versions of the kernel use 1024 and this is good choice.  Since
   the C library implementation of readv/writev is able to emulate the
   functionality even if the currently running kernel does not support
   this large value the readv/writev call will not fail because of this.  */
